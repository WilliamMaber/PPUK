After a brief hiatus, we're back and ready to fight for digital rights and privacy.</p><p>As you may already know, Pirate Party UK was founded in 2009 to promote digital freedom, civil liberties, and government transparency. Over the years, we've been at the forefront of many important campaigns, such as fighting against mass surveillance, defending the right to free speech, and advocating for copyright reform.</p><p>However, in recent years, we've faced some challenges that have made it difficult for us to operate at full capacity. But, we're not ones to give up easily, and we're now ready to relaunch with renewed vigour and determination.</p><p>We believe that the current political climate makes it more important than ever to stand up for digital rights and privacy. With the rise of Big Tech and the increasing use of data for commercial and political purposes, we need a strong voice to ensure that our rights are protected.</p><p>So, we're calling on all like-minded individuals to join us in our fight. Whether you're a techie, a privacy advocate, or just someone who believes in the importance of civil liberties, we want you on board!</p><p>In addition to our core values, we also believe in promoting social justice and equality for all. We support the rights of marginalized communities, including the LGBTQIA+ community.</p><p>Trans individuals have long been marginalized and discriminated against, and it's our duty to fight for their rights and ensure that they're treated with the dignity and respect that they deserve. We fully support LGBTQIA+ rights, including trans rights.</p><p>We believe that everyone has the right to live their life free from fear of discrimination or persecution, and we'll continue to work towards a society that is inclusive and welcoming for all, regardless of their gender identity or sexual orientation.</p><p>In the coming weeks and months, we'll be rolling out new initiatives and campaigns to promote digital freedom, government transparency, and social justice. We'll also be working to rebuild our organization and strengthen our ties with other like-minded groups and individuals.</p><p>So, stay tuned for more updates, and join us on our journey to create a freer, fairer, and more transparent society!</p><p>Yarrrr!</p></div></div><div class="mt-5 navbar fixed-bottom bg-body-tertiary bg-dark" data-bs-theme="dark"><div class="col-md-3"><span class="mb-3 mb-md-0 text-body-secondary">Copyright &copy; 2023 Pirate Party UK</span></div><div class="col-md-3 text-end"><span class="mb-3 mb-md-0 text-body-secondary"><a href="https://discord.gg/t8EDRgXzMH" class="bi bi-discord"></a> </span><span class="mb-3 mb-md-0 text-body-secondary"><a href="https://github.com/pirate-party-uk" class="bi bi-github"></a></span></div></div></body></html>
