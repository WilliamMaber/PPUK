Recently, a UN independent expert on violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, Victor Madrigal-Borloz, expressed his concerns about the UK government's failure to ban conversion therapy, something the government had promised to do in 2018 under Theresa May.</p><p>In his report, Madrigal-Borloz expressed his &quot;perplexity&quot; at the government's delay in drafting a bill despite the significant support for the ban among MPs. The government has reportedly finalized consultations and is committed to publishing the draft legislation for pre-legislative scrutiny by the end of autumn 2023. Madrigal-Borloz also noted concerns raised by the Welsh government about the UK government's treatment of the conversion ban and said that Scotland was legislating its own conversion therapy ban.</p><p>Conversion therapy refers to attempts to change a person's sexuality or gender, which all major UK medical organizations agree is impossible. The Pirate Party firmly opposes such practices and believes that everyone should have the right to live their life without fear of discrimination or violence.</p><p>During his visit, Madrigal-Borloz also expressed his deep concern about rising anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric in the UK, which he said had been fueled by &quot;toxic public debate&quot;. He said this rhetoric contributed to biased-motivated incidents of harassment, threats, and violence against LGBTQ+ people, including a surge in hate crimes.</p><p>The Pirate Party believes that the UK government must take action to address these issues and protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. We stand in solidarity with LGBTQ+ activists and organizations who are fighting for the rights of their communities and urge the government to prioritize their concerns and take meaningful steps towards ensuring equality and justice for all.</p></div></div><div class="mt-5 navbar fixed-bottom bg-body-tertiary bg-dark" data-bs-theme="dark"><div class="col-md-3"><span class="mb-3 mb-md-0 text-body-secondary">Copyright &copy; 2023 Pirate Party UK</span></div><div class="col-md-3 text-end"><span class="mb-3 mb-md-0 text-body-secondary"><a href="https://discord.gg/t8EDRgXzMH" class="bi bi-discord"></a> </span><span class="mb-3 mb-md-0 text-body-secondary"><a href="https://github.com/pirate-party-uk" class="bi bi-github"></a></span></div></div></body></html>
