  <h1> What we believe </h1>
   <main>
    The Pirate Party in the UK adopted a set of nine principles on which its policies are based. All the policies and ideas you see here, as well as the stances we take in our advocacy, local or national campaigning, come from these seven principles. They determine whether we can or cannot support a specific initiative and they should be sufficient to determine our position on any number of issues, whether outlined in our manifesto or additional policy documents or not:
    <ul>
      <li>Sharing – Our society is built upon the sharing of knowledge, ideas, and culture. It is furthered by freedom of thought and expression, and protected by the rule of law. The Pirate Party exists to ensure the preservation and development of these foundations.</li>
      <li>Security - To ensure the security of our society, it is the responsibility of the government to provide for its defence, the mechanisms of justice and such services and infrastructure required to meet its needs.</li>
      <li>Equal - All are equal under the law. We all have a say in the structure and processes of governance and a right to know what is done on our behalf.</li>
      <li>Evidence - We will act on the basis of evidence, with the consent of society through democracy in the interests of all.</li>
      <li>Participation - To be free to participate in society, everyone must have access to justice, education, and such services and infrastructure required for life within it.</li>
      <li>Respect - Respect for our private and family life by government and society is fundamental, and we all have freedom of choice in our associations and relationships.</li>
      <li>Dignity - Human dignity is inviolable. Each of us has a right to life and to live, to freedom of thought and self-determination, and to participate in society.</li>
      <li>Inclusivity - The Pirate Party is committed to promoting inclusivity, including but not limited to, protecting the rights and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their age, race, ethnicity, LGBTQIA+, religion, or physical or mental ability.</li>
      <li>Openness - The Pirate Party is committed to promoting openness, transparency, and accountability in all aspects of governance and decision-making.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Our Policies</h1>
    <p>Democracy is in crisis in the United Kingdom. Whether it is online or on the doorstep, people are telling us that they feel alienated, ignored, that they have given up voting as it changes nothing.</p>
    <p>It's this sense of powerlessness over the forces that shape our lives and the space around us that is so worrying in the UK today. Creeping privatisation means all aspects of our society are being divided up and parcelled out. It can be impossible to find out who is responsible for the most basic aspects of our environment, public spaces and services, let alone get anyone to do anything about it.</p>
    <p>The Pirate Party develops policy in a collaborative manner, allowing anyone to have input and ultimately allowing its members to make the decision as to what the party stands for. The policies you find on these pages are the result of a process that allows us to refine and continually assess our positions, a process that we would encourage you to take part in.</p>
